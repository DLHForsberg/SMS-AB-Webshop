# SMS-AB-Webshop
Webshop made in a school project for a made up company.

The application is built in PHP and connects to a database in a business management solution called Openbravo
in order to get the products in that database.

The application has a shopping cart using a MySQL database to store customers carts that with login to the site so they
can come back and complete their order at a later date. When the purchase is confirmed an email i sent to the customer
with a receipt of the purchase. This was done using Googles mail servers.
